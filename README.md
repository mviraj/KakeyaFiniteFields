## 📋 About the Project
This project addresses the Kakeya set problem over finite fields. It aims to show that any Kakeya set \( K \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n \) must have a size of at least \( C_n \cdot q^n \). The constant \( C_n \) depends only on the dimension \( n \).

### 📖 Technical Highlights
- **Target:** Complete formalization of the finite field Kakeya theorem.
- **Scope:** About 300 lines of Lean code.
- **Workflow:** AI-driven formalization guided by a LaTeX blueprint.
- **Foundation:** Concepts like polynomial interpolation and homogeneous components.
- **Result:** Full theorem proving the minimum size of Kakeya sets.

## 🛠 Installation Requirements
To use KakeyaFiniteFields, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10, macOS, or Linux (latest versions recommended)
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB RAM
